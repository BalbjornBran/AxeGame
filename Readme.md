#Axe Game
By Balbjorn Bran
	
We are going to create a very simple "Axe Game" using Raylib's library in c++ language.
This exercise purpose is to learn the basics of c++. The game is extremely simple, its 
just for learning purposes, we're not going to create functions, just everything inside 
main.

The player will have to collect points, once the player gets 100 points. The player will
win the game.

The axe will be moving up and down, if it hits the player, the player will die and the 
game is over.

I'm sharing the workspace used with visual studio but the actual game compiled is called
"Axe_Game.exe". You can download and try yourself. Otherwise, if you're interested in 
just see the code, open "Axe_Game.cpp" file. If you're downloading the file, just open 
it with your IDE of preference or any text editor.
